## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Dual Camera Capture (Front + Rear Together)
* **Simultaneous Multi-Cam Feed:** Powered by `AVCaptureMultiCamSession` on physical devices, rendering real-time front and rear camera views simultaneously.
* **Layout Mode:**
  * **Picture-in-Picture (PiP):** 100% full screen edge-to-edge camera feed with floating selfie bubble. Tap the bubble to swap primary and selfie cameras!
* **Dual Keepsake Photos:**
  * Generates a high-resolution composite photo (with cute rounded borders, date watermark, and active sticker overlays).
  * Automatically saves individual front and rear shots to the Apple Photos library.
* **Simulator & Fallback Engine:** Graceful fallback for simulator and older hardware with interactive toddler animations and realistic photo synthesis.

### 2. Toddler-Friendly & Child-Safe UI
* **Big Bouncy Shutter Button:** Chunky 86pt tactile button with animated press states and crisp haptic feedback.
* **Clean Toddler Screen (Zero Clutter):** No confusing emoji toolbars or settings buttons on the phone; the screen is locked and simplified so toddlers focus on holding and taking photos.
* **Native Apple Vision Face Tracking:** Emojis (🦁 Lion, 👑 Crown, 🕶️ Sunglasses, 🐱 Kitty, 🐶 Puppy, 🦄 Unicorn, 🐼 Panda, 🐰 Bunny, ⭐️ Star Eyes) automatically track the toddler's face in real-time using `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest`.
* **Toddler Screen Lock:** Replaces touch gestures with an interactive bubble popping canvas (🫧, ⭐, ❤️, 🎵). Tapping produces playful pop sounds without breaking the camera stream.
* **Parental Gate:** Access to Settings, Gallery, and Guided Access tutorials is secured behind a math challenge to prevent accidental toddler navigation.
* **Built-in Soundboard:** Playful synthesized sound effects (Shutter chime, Puppy bark, Kitty meow, Duck quack, Baby giggle, Clown horn, Spring boing).

### 3. Apple Watch Remote Control
* **Parent Remote on Apple Watch (`KidsCamWatch`):**
  * Control the camera and filters from your wrist while your toddler holds the phone!
  * **Face Masks Remote Settings:** Choose or clear face tracking masks (Crown, Lion, Sunglasses, etc.) from the watch while the phone remains safely locked in toddler hands.
  * **Wrist Shutter:** Big, tactile shutter button with watch haptics (`WKInterfaceDevice`).
  * **Silly Attention Grabbers:** Tap 🐶 Puppy Bark, 🦆 Duck Quack, 🐱 Kitten Meow, or 👶 Baby Giggle on the watch to make the iPhone blast that sound, getting your child to look up and smile!
  * **Remote Screen Lock:** Remotely toggle the toddler screen lock on the phone.
  * **Camera Swap:** Switch front / rear cameras from your watch.
  * **Last Photo Thumbnail Review:** Instantly inspect the captured photo on your wrist.

### 4. Guided Access Education & Settings Shortcut
* **Full Toddler Safe Mode:** Triple-clicking the side button locks the toddler into ToddlerCam, disabling home bar swipe gestures, notification center, control center, and volume/power buttons.
* **Direct Settings Link:** Opens the iOS Settings app directly to Accessibility.
* **Live Status Detection:** Utilizes `UIAccessibility.isGuidedAccessEnabled` and `guidedAccessStatusDidChangeNotification` to display a live security badge.
* **Visual 4-Step Parent Guide:** Illustrated tutorial explaining one-time setup and how to start/exit Guided Access safely.

### 5. Watch Face Studio & Complications in Phone iOS App
* **Complication Settings:**
  * Configure what action the watch face complication performs: Quick Shutter, Silly Sound, Full Remote, or Status.
  * Syncs complication data directly to the Apple Watch via `WCSession.default.transferCurrentComplicationUserInfo`.
  * Deep links directly to the Apple Watch app on iOS (`watch://`).
* **Toddler Photo Watch Face Creator:**
  * Pick any captured dual-camera photo from ToddlerCam or your photo library.
  * Live interactive Apple Watch mockup preview (chassis frame, digital time display, customizable colors, top/bottom time position).
  * Direct "Add to Apple Watch Face" action via iOS Share Sheet ("Create Watch Face" extension) and ClockKit photo formatting.

### 6. 100% Child Safe & COPPA Compliant
* Built strictly according to **Apple App Store Review Guidelines for the Kids Category (Guideline 1.3 & 5.1.4)** and **COPPA**.
* **Zero Data Collection:** No third-party SDKs, no tracking, no ads, no analytics.
* Everything runs 100% on-device and offline.
